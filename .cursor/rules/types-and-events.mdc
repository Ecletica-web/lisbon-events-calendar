# Events and types

- **Canonical event type** — Domain shape is in `models/Event`. CSV columns are defined in `data/schema/eventColumns.ts`; see `docs/SCHEMA.md` for the contract.
- **Pipeline** — CSV/Sheets → `data/loaders/eventsLoader` (loadEvents, filterEventsForListing) → `lib/eventsAdapter` (fetchEvents, NormalizedEvent for FullCalendar). Venues and promoters flow through the same adapter (fetchVenues, fetchPromoters).
- **Single public API** — Use `lib/eventsAdapter` for all "get events/venues/promoters" and filtering. Do not add new ad-hoc fetch paths or duplicate types. Do not use `lib/events.ts` (legacy/deprecated).
- **Extending** — To add fields or behavior: extend the loader or adapter in place, or add a small helper in the same layer; keep one pipeline.
